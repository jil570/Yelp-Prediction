\section{Motivation}

With the ever lowering entry barrier for video publication on platforms like YouTube and Instagram, more and more people start to regard these platforms as simple way to convey their ideas and start to play a more significant role in peopleâ€™s life. It has become a way to get to know people around the world as well as for the world to know you. With more sponsors pouring more money on creators, predicting the popularity of a new upcoming video upload has its business importance. We want to create a model to predict how popular a video might become to assist with such business decisions.\\
Datasets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Trending Youtube Video Stats: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new
\item Youtube Channels: https://www.kaggle.com/babikov/youtube-channels-100000
\item Trending Youtube (with comments): https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube
\end{itemize}
\item $\textbf{N}$ - number of youtube trending videos
\item $\textbf{p}$ - related features: trending date, title, channel title, category, publish time, tags, views, likes, dislike, comment count, thumbnail, video description, is comments disabled, is rating disabled, comments

\section{Related Work}

%\textit{Tip: we suggest using bibtex for easy citation management. For example, here are citations to Bishop's book \cite{Bishop06} and the UCI machine learning repository \cite{DuaKa17}.} \\ \\
To come up with our unique solution to the proposed problem, we referenced these above two publications. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first publication named \textit{Web Video Popularity Prediction using Sentiment and Content Visual Features} \cite{vp1} showcased a way to integrate sentiment features on titles and content visual features (thumbnails) into popularity analysis.
    \item The second publication we found named \textit{Popularity Prediction of Videos in YouTube as Case Study: A Regression Analysis Study} \cite{vp2} showcased logistic regression to predict popularity based on a variety number of features, and used step-wise regression to pick out a minimum number of features to maximize prediction accuracy.
\end{itemize}


\section{Problem Formulation}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We choose "view counts" $(y)$ as a proxy for determining the popularity of a video.
    \item Cluster factors that influences the view count of a YouTube Video.
    \item Use dimension reduction methods to filter features based on their effect on view count.
    \item Perform regression on the set of selected features to predict the view count of a YouTube video.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cluster factors: K-means Clustering
    \item Filter features: Principal Components Analysis 
    \item Predict view count: Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Convolutional Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}
For evaluation, we will first use MSE as a measure of accuracy of our project. Since we are predicting the potential view counts of a YouTube video, MSE will be a more reasonable way to learn the result of our predicting model.
\begin{itemize}
    \item MSE = $\frac{1}{n}*\sum$(predicted $\hat{y}$  - actual $y$)$^2$
\end{itemize}
